The RADON Particles repository contains TOSCA blueprints, reusable definitions and extensions to deploy and manage RADON applications.
It provides reusable TOSCA types of application runtimes, computing resources, and FaaS platforms in the form of abstract as well as deployable modeling entities.
The repository also comprises RADON's FaaS abstraction layer that provides several TOSCA definitions to deploy a particular FaaS application component to different cloud providers.
